# To be continued or discontinued: investigating secret formula for successful movie franchise

## Abstract

We often hear that the second movie in a franchise is always worse than the first. However, human memories tend to be influenced by nostalgia, and it remains uncertain if this classic dinner table debate stands on tangible evidence. In this project, we aim to settle this debate by analyzing the list of movies and supplemental data from [the CMU Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). The preliminary question to this analysis is, "What makes a good movie?" Are franchise movies more profitable than non-franchise movies? In search of answers to these questions, we investigate various metrics such as box office revenue, viewer rating, diversity representation etc., for franchise movies and make a contrast to non-franchise movies.

## Research Questions

Following the objectives discussed in the abstract, here is the list of concrete questions to tackle with:

* Do franchise movies degrade in quality and box office revenue as the sequel continues?
* Is there an underlying pattern of features that makes franchise movies successful?
  * Do some movie genres achieve higher box office revenue in moive franchise than the others? Is the trend consistent in non-franchise movies as well?
  * What are the features that are most useful in predicting box office revenue?
  * Do actors of certain ethnicity groups play particular personas more frequently? Are they depicted positively (hero/heroine) or negatively (villain) in the movie?
  
## Proposed additional dataset

We complement our movie data by merging data from [the movie database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). This community-based movie database offers free API for non-commercial use, and we used the database to identify franchise movies in the CMU dataset. We also queried additional features for each movie to utilize them in our analysis. The table below shows the summary of newly added features:

| **Feature**                | **Description**                                                   |
